  "description": "Replace greedy schedule algorithm with a proper constraint satisfaction solver (backtracking CSP) to guarantee 100% valid NFL schedules with all 272 games placed",
  "goal": "Guarantee all 272 games are placed every time with fast performance (under 5 seconds)",
  "requirements": [
    "All 272 games placed - every team gets exactly 17 games",
    "Proper bye week distribution - each team has 1 bye in weeks 5-14",
    "Division games correct - 6 division games per team (2 vs each rival)",
    "No duplicate matchups - teams play each other max 2 times",
    "Pure TypeScript implementation - no external solver dependencies",
    "Fast execution - schedule generation under 5 seconds"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [
    "TV slot optimization and primetime game assignment",
    "Travel distance minimization",
    "Competitive balance and strength of schedule optimization",
    "Stadium conflicts and shared venue scheduling"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Must be browser-compatible (client-side execution)",
    "Pure TypeScript - no WASM or external binaries",
    "Fallback to current greedy algorithm if solver times out",
    "Must integrate with existing schedule-generator.ts structure"
