  "description": "Fix critical issues in player-generator.ts identified by multi-AI review: attribute tier system not applied, unused point budget code, badge tier logic inverted, trait filtering issues",
  "category": "fix",
  "priority": "high",
  "created": "2025-12-06T22:40:00Z",
  "status": "stub",
  "notes": "Comprehensive review from ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Le Chat, and Grok - see feedback.md",
  "key_issues": [
    "Attribute generation ignores calculated point budgets - archetypes feel same-y",
    "Primary/Secondary/Tertiary tiers barely affect output",
    "Badge tier bonus logic is inverted (higher OVR makes bronze more likely)",
    "Trait filtering may fail if TRAITS structure doesn't match expected format",
    "Missing TypeScript generics on getRandomItem/weightedRandom",
    "Unused imports: TRAITS_BY_RARITY, BADGES, BADGE_TIER_WEIGHTS"
  ],
  "recommended_phases": [
    "Phase 1: Type & Safety Fixes (generics, empty array guards, validation)",
    "Phase 2: Domain Logic (fix attribute tier system, badge logic, trait generation)",
    "Phase 3: I/O & Environment (abstract name loading, handle CSV edge cases)",
    "Phase 4: Testing (unit tests for archetypes, traits, badges)"
  ]
