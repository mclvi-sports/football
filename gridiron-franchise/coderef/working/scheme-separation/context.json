  "feature_name": "scheme-separation",
  "description": "Separate the schemes system from the coaching staff system to have a clear separation of concerns. Schemes should be their own module that coaches reference, not embed.",
  "goal": "Create a standalone schemes module (src/lib/schemes/) with full scheme definitions, player fit calculations, and simulation integration. Refactor the coaching module to reference schemes instead of defining them inline.",
  "requirements": [
    "Create new src/lib/schemes/ module with types.ts, scheme-data.ts, and scheme-fit.ts",
    "Move all scheme definitions (offensive, defensive, ST) from coaching to schemes module",
    "Update Coach interface: HC gets both offensive AND defensive scheme, OC gets offensive, DC gets defensive, STC gets ST philosophy",
    "Rename coach position ST to STC (Special Teams Coordinator)",
    "Add Players Coach perk to HC perks",
    "Implement player scheme fit system with 5 levels: Perfect (+5), Good (+2), Neutral (0), Poor (-2), Terrible (-5)",
    "Add scheme adjustment period logic (4 weeks when schemes change)",
    "Update coaching generator to use new scheme structure",
    "Update coaching dev tools UI to reflect changes"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [
    "Simulation engine integration (will be separate work)",
    "Player generation integration with scheme fit",
    "Schemes dev tool UI page (optional future enhancement)"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Must maintain backwards compatibility with existing coaching data structure",
    "Follow existing dev-tools patterns for consistency",
    "Schemes are reference data, not generated data like coaches",
    "Must align with FINAL-schemes-system.md specifications"
