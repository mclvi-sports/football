  "description": "Comprehensive fix for disconnected simulation systems - wire badge effects to all positions, apply scheme attribute bonuses, integrate coaching perks and facility XP bonuses into progression engine",
  "goal": "Make the simulation modifier systems actually work - currently 85% of badges, 80% of coaching perks, and 100% of facility XP bonuses are dead code that's calculated but never applied",
  "requirements": [
    "Wire badge effects to all positions (not just QB) - add playTypes receive, block, rush",
    "Call getSchemeAttributeBonuses() and calculateSchemeGameModifiers() in simulator",
    "Apply defensive scheme effects to play outcomes",
    "Connect calculateCoachingXpBonuses() to progression engine",
    "Connect calculateFacilitySeasonalEffects() to training system",
    "Add guaranteed money and dead cap to contracts",
    "Implement age-based attribute decline curves by position"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [],
  "constraints": [
    "Must not break existing game simulation flow",
    "Badge multipliers should be meaningful (0.5x-1.0x not 0.01x)",
    "Maintain backwards compatibility with existing save data"
