- Value "Gym Rats" for long-term development

**Draft Strategy:**
- Target "Gym Rat" + "Early Bloomer" for quick impact
- Target "Late Bloomer" for long-term value
- Avoid "Lazy" + "Injury Prone" combination

**Contract Decisions:**
- Re-sign "Loyal" and "Team First" players first
- Let "Money Motivated" + "Mercenary" walk in free agency
- Extend "Ring Chasers" on cheap deals late in career

**Roster Balance:**
- Need at least 2-3 "Vocal Leaders" on team
- Limit "Hot Heads" and "Undisciplined" players
- Prioritize "Ice in Veins" for QB/Kicker

## NOTES

### Balance Considerations
- Positive traits slightly more common than negative
- Super impactful traits (Iron Man, Ice in Veins) very rare
- Most players have neutral-to-slightly-positive traits
- Negative traits should have some upside (Hot Head = +2 Strength)

### Realism vs. Fun
- Traits create stories and tough decisions
- Some traits feel "unfair" but create engagement
- Balance game impact with narrative value

### Future Expansion
- Add trait evolution system (traits change over career)
