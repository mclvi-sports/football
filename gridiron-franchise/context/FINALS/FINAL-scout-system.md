# PART 14: INTEGRATION WITH DRAFT CLASS

## How Scouting Affects Draft

From `FINAL-draft-class-system.md`, scouting accuracy determines what you see:

| Scout Rating | OVR Accuracy | Traits Visible | Bust/Steal Warning |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Elite (90-99) | ±1-2 OVR | 80% of traits | High accuracy |
| Good (80-89) | ±2-4 OVR | 60% of traits | Moderate |
| Average (70-79) | ±4-6 OVR | 40% of traits | Low |
| Poor (60-69) | ±6-10 OVR | 20% of traits | Very low |

### True OVR vs Scouted OVR

- **True OVR:** Actual player rating (hidden)
- **Scouted OVR:** What scout reports (may be wrong)
- **Reveal:** True OVR revealed after Year 2 in league

```
