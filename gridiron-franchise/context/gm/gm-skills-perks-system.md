## Balancing Considerations

### Skill Power Levels
- Bronze skills: Noticeable but not game-breaking
- Silver skills: Significant advantage
- Gold skills: Powerful but requires major investment

### Stacking Rules
- Most skills: Only 1 per type can be equipped
- Position Guru: Can stack multiple for different positions
- Some skills have diminishing returns when combined

### Economy Balance
- Average GM Points per season: ~200-300 (with decent performance)
- Championship run: ~500-800 points
- Time to max out skills: ~5-7 successful seasons
- Keep scarcity so choices matter

---

## Future Expansion Ideas

### Prestige Skills (Post-Launch)
- Unlock after winning 5+ championships
- Ultra-powerful gold+ tier skills
- Legendary GM status

### Seasonal Skills (Limited Time)
- Special event skills available for limited seasons
- Unique buffs not in standard pool
- Creates FOMO and engagement

### Skill Sets (Combos)
- Equipping certain skill combinations unlocks bonus effects
- Example: "The Scout" set (3 scouting skills) = extra draft pick
- Example: "The Builder" set (development skills) = faster team chemistry
