## BADGE SYNERGIES

### Stackable Combinations

- In playoff game, trailing in 4Q, final 2 min = +34 to all attributes

**Red Zone Domination:**
- Red Zone Threat (Gold) + Prime Time (Silver) + Clutch (Gold)
- Prime time game, red zone, final 2 min = +19 combined boost

**Defensive Lockdown:**
- Shutdown Corner (Gold) + Playoff Performer (Silver) + Big Game Player (Gold)
- Playoff game with implications, man coverage = +20 to coverage attributes

## NOTES

### Balance Considerations
- XP should be scarce enough that badge choices matter
- Performance-based badges are more prestigious
- Hall of Fame tier should feel legendary (5% of players)
- Situational nature prevents "always on" power creep

### Design Philosophy
- Badges reward specific playstyles
- Create meaningful build diversity
- Situational activation prevents overpowered stacking
- Mix of earned and purchased creates progression paths

### Future Expansion
- Team chemistry badges (bonus when multiple players have same badge)
- Legacy badges (transferred from retired players)
- Seasonal badges (special limited-time badges)
- Achievement badges for career milestones
